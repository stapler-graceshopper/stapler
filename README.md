Stapler was built using React and Redux for state management on the front-end, and was styled using CSS. The back-end and database was done using Express, Sequelize, Postgres and Node.js.

# Setup & Start

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Sync and seed your database by running `npm run seed`
3. Use `npm run start:dev` to start a local server (on port 8080)
